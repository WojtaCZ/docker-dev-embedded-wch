# Generic riscv-none-elf toolchain file for WCH CH32V / CH32X firmware.

# Baked into the image at /opt/embedded/cmake/toolchains/riscv-none-elf.cmake.
# Gives CMake-based WCH projects the same tasks.json / launch.json flow the arm
# leaf has, as an alternative to ch32fun's Makefiles.

#   Part       Core          RISCV_MARCH         RISCV_MABI
#   CH32V003   QingKe V2A    rv32ec_zicsr        ilp32e     <- 16 registers only
#   CH32V103   QingKe V3     rv32imac_zicsr      ilp32
#   CH32V203   QingKe V4B    rv32imac_zicsr      ilp32
#   CH32V303   QingKe V4F    rv32imafc_zicsr     ilp32f     <- has an FPU
#   CH32X033   QingKe V4C    rv32imac_zicsr      ilp32
#
# RV32EC (the V003) has 16 integer registers instead of 32 and NO hardware
# multiply. `ilp32e` is not ABI-compatible with `ilp32`, so a library built for
# one will not link against the other — this is why march/mabi must be explicit.
